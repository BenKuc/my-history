1) Installation
    ...
    Now go on with Settings.
2) Settings
    General: Put the app name you want to use after all other apps in
             INSTALLED_APPS that contain models to be tracked by KeepTrack.

    In your django settings.py file you can specify custom settings for the
    KeepTrack app as dictionary with variable name: KEEP_TRACK.

    a) APP_NAME
        This is the name for the app to be used. See installation to make this
        work accurately with the name of the actual module, which must be
        consistent.
    b) VERBOSE_APP_NAME
        The verbose name of the history app.
    c) GLOBAL_EXTRA_FIELDS
        Here you can provide the path to a list/tuple/set that contains extra
        fields to be tracked by every track-model (such as user).
        This is a string that consists of the path to the file/module the
        iterable is contained in and then separated by a '.' the name of the
        iterable in that module.
        The elements in the iterable are 3-tuples:
            (name: str, field: django.db.models.Field, value: hardcoded value or callable)
3) Track-Models
4) Queries
5) API and managers
